##introduction

The Google Data Analytics Certification course has equipped me with a variety of skills, all culminating in this capstone project. As a Junior Data Analyst at Cyclistic, a major bike-sharing company, I was given the opportunity to dig deep into a comprehensive dataset and extract insightful knowledge.

Cyclistic categorizes its riders into two distinct types: "casual" members, who sporadically use the service via individual passes, and subscribers, who maintain a long-term commitment with annual memberships. Stationed in a major city, Cyclistic operates an extensive network of around 6,000 bicycles across 700 stations. A key growth factor for Cyclistic lies in maximizing its number of annual subscribers, a strategy that promises sustained customer engagement and financial stability.

The objective of this analysis is to unearth valuable insights that could guide effective marketing strategies aimed at transforming casual members into annual subscribers.
