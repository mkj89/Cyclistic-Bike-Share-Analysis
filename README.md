# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
This project represents an in-depth analysis of Cyclistic, a thriving bike-sharing company. As a data analyst for Cyclistic, my role was to leverage data in order to understand how customers interact with the bike-sharing service. The goal of the study was to find out how annual members and casual riders differ in their usage patterns.
